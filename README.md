# Python-chat
# This is a program that was created in one of my undergrad classes, the purpose of this program was to learn about networking concepts.
# The idea for the program was to create a sort of reminder system, that a user could send a sound bite to the person they are chatting  
# to and remind them about an unread message. I got the original code from a user on GitHub that user is: 
# https://github.com/JackZProduction/python_chat 
# The original idea that I had was not really thought out fully, and the concept of socket programming with python was an unknown concept # to me. The original code had everything a chatting system would need, so what I did add did seem rather trivial. If I could go back and # add to this program along with understanding python socket programming I would probably make some sort of a game.
